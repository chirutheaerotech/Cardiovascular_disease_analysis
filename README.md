CardioVascular Disease Analysis using Machine Learning
The dataset had information about individuals, and I looked into different aspects. I checked the shape of the dataset, which had a specific number of rows and columns.
I gathered information about the dataset, like data types, total rows, total columns, and memory usage. I also checked for null values and got rid of duplicate entries.
I went further into the analysis by examining specific aspects of the data. I determined the number of people with and without heart disease, counted the males and females, and explored the age distribution. 
I also looked into chest pain types and how they related to the target variable. Additionally, I analyzed variables like fasting blood sugar levels, resting blood pressure, serum cholesterol, and other continuous
variables. I compared these variables based on gender to see if there were any differences in health indicators.

Throughout the analysis, I used visualizations and statistical summaries to gain insights from the dataset. This project not only showed manual exploratory data analysis techniques but also demonstrated 
how pandas can effectively handle and analyze real-world health data. These analyses revealed patterns and correlations that provided valuable insights into the factors associated with heart disease. 
This information provided me an insight of the feature selection, the columns which had a great impact on the target value so i first differentiated the categorical and continous columns. 
The columns which are categorical i made them as dummy variables and the continous  are used for predicting the output accuracy. Lastly i used the RandomForest classifier method for prediction which came out to be 
81%.
